Assign variable names to the input ports and specify their respective bitwidths after a colon. The variable naming and bitwidth specification should conform to the following rules.
* Grouped input ports should be assigned a single variable name with the number of grouped ports specified inside square brackets. Example, `in0[4]:32`, where in0 is the port name, [4] indicates 4 ports being grouped together and 32 is the bitwidth of each port in the grouping.
* Single input ports are only assigned variable names and their bitwidth after a colon. Example, `dataIn:64`, where dataIn is the variable name of the port and 64 is its bitwidth.
* There should be no whitespaces in the variable name.
