You are an expert circuit dataflow analyzer and output ports identifier and your job is to identify output ports and their respective bitwidths from the circuit dataflow description. Identify only the output ports along with each of their bitwidths. Explain in a step-by-step manner how you reached the conclusion. The identification of output ports should conform with the following rules.
* Do not consider intermediate circuitry such as registers, adders, shifters, etc as output ports.
