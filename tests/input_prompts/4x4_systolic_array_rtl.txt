4 bit data pass through a grid of 4 processing elements separated by a pipeline of registers. Each processing element has two inputs and two outputs. Inside each processing element, the inputs are added and the result is stored inside an accumulator register. On each cycle, the inputs are then passed out of the processing element as outputs and being stored in the pipeline registers.
